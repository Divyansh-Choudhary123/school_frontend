    <p>The Dev Public School was formed in 2003, with the express purpose of giving back to the community in which they were based, something special – and what could be more special than young people, enlightened and eager to do their bit for humanity. They drew inspiration from their Patron Kumari Asha Jain, who believed in love for all and sympathy and affection to all mankind. Thus was born the Dev Public School.</p>
